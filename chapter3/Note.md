# list
list is a container to store a set of value of any data type
in a way we can consider it as an array with hetroginious elements/datatype
>MyList=["vishwa",101,0.59]
>print(MyList)

>print(MyList[0])

we can use same method in both list and string for getting index of list or character in string

### strings are immutable and list is not
## Example:-
>a="omg"\
a[1]="n" #Error

>MyList=["vishwa",101,0.59]
MyList[0]=10 #Sucess\
#[10, 101, 0.59]
